# Servival-analysis-for-employe-turnover
the goal is to analyze and understand the factors that contribute to employee attrition or turnover within an organization. 
Survival analysis is a statistical method used to examine the time it takes for an event of interest, such as employee turnover, to occur.


The project begins by gathering relevant data, including employee profiles, employment history, performance metrics, and any other relevant variables.
This data is then prepared and processed for analysis.


Survival analysis techniques, such as the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards model, are applied to explore the probability of employee turnover over time and identify the factors that influence attrition rates. 
These factors can include demographics, job satisfaction, compensation, career growth opportunities, and work-life balance.


By conducting survival analysis, the project aims to answer critical questions, such as the median tenure of employees, the likelihood of turnover at different time intervals, and the impact of various factors on employee attrition.
Additionally, the project can provide insights into the risk of turnover for specific employee segments or departments within the organization.


The results and findings from the analysis can then be used to inform strategic decisions and develop targeted interventions to reduce employee turnover.
This may involve implementing employee engagement initiatives, improving retention strategies, refining compensation and benefits packages, or addressing specific pain points identified through the analysis.


Ultimately, the project leverages survival analysis to gain a deeper understanding of employee turnover patterns and the underlying factors driving attrition. 
By uncovering these insights, organizations can take proactive measures to enhance employee satisfaction, increase retention rates, and foster a more productive and stable workforce.
